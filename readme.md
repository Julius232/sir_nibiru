# Sir Nibiru Project

This project is a PHP, Node.js, and JavaScript-based application with a MySQL database. It is designed to run on a XAMPP server and uses Webpack for bundling JavaScript files. This README will guide you through setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **XAMPP** - A local server environment to run PHP and MySQL.
  - [Download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and install it.
- **Node.js and npm** - Required to run the build scripts and manage dependencies.
  - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (npm is included with Node.js).

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository into the XAMPP `htdocs` folder:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Julius232/sir_nibiru.git
C:\xampp\htdocs\sir_nibiru

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
Start the Apache and MySQL modules.

### Step 3: Configure MySQL Database
Open phpMyAdmin by navigating to http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser.
Create a new database for the project (e.g., sir_nibiru_db).
Import any required SQL files for your database schema if available.

### Step 4: Install Node.js Dependencies
```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\sir_nibiru\node
npm install

### Step 5: Run the Build
```bash
npm run build

### Folder Structure
PHP Backend: The PHP files for the backend are in the root project directory (e.g., index.php, data.php, submit_signature.php).
Node and Webpack: All Node.js and Webpack configurations are located in the node folder.
src/script.js: The main JavaScript source file.
webpack.config.js: Webpack configuration file.
package.json: Lists dependencies and scripts for npm.
Running the Project
Once everything is set up:

Ensure that Apache and MySQL are running in XAMPP.
Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost/sir_nibiru to access the application.
Additional Information
npm: Make sure npm is in your PATH. You can verify by running npm -v in your command prompt.
MySQL Database Configuration: If your PHP code connects to the MySQL database, update the database credentials (host, username, password, and database name) in your PHP files.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors related to missing Node modules, ensure youâ€™re in the node directory and run npm install.
Make sure XAMPP Apache and MySQL modules are running, and check that your MySQL database is correctly configured.
